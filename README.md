# Blood-Donation
The Blood Donation Management System is a web app that connects donors and recipients. Users can register, schedule donations, request blood, and find available donors. Hospitals manage blood inventory, while donors receive updates. Built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it streamlines the donation and request process efficiently
